👋 Hey there! I'm Gunnar, an Assistant Professor in Physical Geography at the University of Groningen, where I esearch the use of Machine Learning in Ecology and Geospatial Data Science.

🌍 By day, I explore natural environments, and by night, I’m coding away tutorial projects and webapps. I’m also developing courses in Python, Dart, Scikit-Learn, JavaScript, and React to share my love for coding with others. You can check out my courses at [Code With Gunnar](https://codewithgunnar.com).

🚀 Got an exciting project idea? Whether it’s about learning tech, climate solutions, or something else cool, I’m always up for a new challenge and collaboration.

📬 Feel free to reach out to me on Instagram, here on GitHub, or via my university email. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!

Looking forward to hearing from you!
