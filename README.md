👋 Hey there! I'm Gunnar, an Assistant Professor in Physical Geography at the University of Groningen. When I'm not studying the impacts of climate change, you’ll find me immersed in Geospatial Data Science and Machine Learning projects.

🌍 By day, I explore natural environments, and by night, I’m coding away on mobile apps and webapps. I’m also developing courses in Python, Dart, JavaScript, and React to share my love for coding with others.

🚀 Got an exciting project idea? Whether it’s about learning tech, climate solutions, or something else cool, I’m always up for a new challenge and collaboration.

📬 Feel free to reach out to me on Instagram, here on GitHub, or via my university email. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!

Looking forward to hearing from you!
