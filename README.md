Hey there! I'm Gunnar, an Assistant Professor in Physical Geography at the University of Groningen, where I work in GeoAI and Geospatial Data Science.

By day, I explore natural environments, and by night, I develop Games. Most of the things that you'll find in my repositories are little Game Jam indies. I also developed a Python course. You can check it out at [Code With Gunnar](https://codewithgunnar.com).

Got an exciting project idea? Whether it’s about learning tech, climate solutions, or something else cool, I’m always up for a new challenge and collaboration.

Feel free to reach out to me on Instagram, here on GitHub, or via my university email. Let’s connect and create something amazing together!

Looking forward to hearing from you!
