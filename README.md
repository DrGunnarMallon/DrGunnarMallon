👋 Hi, I’m Gunnar! I'm an Assistant Professor in Physical Geography at the University of Groningen researching the impacts of climate change on the natural environments and developing new learning tools.

👀 I’m particularly interested in data analysis and visualisation, developing learning technologies, web and app development, and learning new exciting things...

🌱 I’m currently learning React Native, to see if it is a viable alternative to Kotlin/Swift for me for app development.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects in the domain of learning technology, data visualisaiton, animal welfare, human rights, and climate technology.

📫 You can reach me on here or on Twitter (@GunnarMallon). It'd be great to hear from you, if you think that there might be a project we'd both be interested in :)
